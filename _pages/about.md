<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

 We focus on advancing human-centered research in `extended reality (XR)`, including `augmented reality (AR)`, `virtual reality (VR)`, and `mixed reality (MR)`. Our research aims to advance immersive and interactive systems by integrating `behavioral` (e.g., using eye-tracking) and/or `environmental understanding` to create XR experiences adapt to users in context. Through interdisciplinary work spanning human-computer interaction, graphics, vision, and machine learning, HeXD Lab develops intelligent XR applications and experiences that prioritize usability, accessibility, and meaningful real-world impact, creating systems that are intuitive, context-aware, and grounded in human behavior and needs.
